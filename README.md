# Leadershipstudy
The quantitative study of the influence of individuals in the senior leadership team on company performance

+++ We are actively looking for collaborators! +++

In this project we want to examine the role managers play in the success or failure of a company.
The brief scope of our analysis:
- Company list: S&P 500
- Time interval: last 30-40 years
- Focus: leadership positions
- Analysis goal: Determine how the financial figures relate to the specific people who run the company. In other words, if and to what extent the trends are carried from one company to another when a particular person changes from the first to the second.
