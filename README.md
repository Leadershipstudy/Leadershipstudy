# Leadershipstudy
The quantitative study of the influence of individuals in the senior leadership team on company performance

+++ We are actively looking for collaborators! +++

In this project we want to examine the role managers play in the success or failure of a company.

The brief scope of our analysis:
- Company list: S&P 500.
- Time interval: last 30-40 years.
- Focus: leadership positions.
- Analysis goal: Determine how the financial figures relate to the specific people who run the company. In other words, if and to what extent the trends are carried from one company to another when a particular person changes from the first to the second.

What we have in mind:
- Collect personal information from publicly available sources for people in leadership positions.
- Collect company-related data from publicly available sources (annual reports, e.t.c.).
- For each person and each company, calculate the success indicators of this company for the time interval in which this person accompanied the company.
- Determine the statistical relationships of how each person influenced the managed company. In addition, check whether personal data play a role, e.g. age and/or education..
- Based on the results of the previous bullet, create the personal ranking of the managers.
